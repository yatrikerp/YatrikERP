## Files Changed

### Backend (3 files)
1. **`backend/routes/ticketPNR.js`** - NEW ⭐
   - Endpoint: `/api/booking/pnr/:pnr`
   - Populates conductor and driver details
   - Returns complete ticket information

2. **`backend/server.js`** - MODIFIED
   - Added ticketPNR route registration

3. **`backend/config/email.js`** - ALREADY CORRECT ✅

   - Professional HTML layout

### Frontend (1 file)

## How It Works

### 1. Booking Flow
```
User Books → Payment → Ticket Created → Email Sent
```

### 2. Ticket Display Flow
```
User Opens Ticket → API Call → Backend Fetches with Crew → Frontend Displays All Details
```

### 3. Data Structure
```javascript
{
  customer: { name, email, phone },
  journey: { from, to, departureTime, arrivalTime },
  pricing: { totalAmount, baseFare, gst },
  bus: { busNumber, busType },
  conductor: { name, email, phone },  // ⭐ NEW
  driver: { name, email, phone }      // ⭐ NEW
}
```
