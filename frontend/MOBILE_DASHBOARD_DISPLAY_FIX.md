# Mobile Passenger Dashboard Display Fix

## Issue Identified:
The mobile passenger dashboard at `/passenger/mobile` was showing a blank white screen with only the bottom navigation visible.

## Root Cause:
The original `MobilePassengerDashboard.jsx` component had structural issues:
1. **Duplicate dashboard content sections** causing rendering conflicts
2. **Content mixed inside mobile menu overlay** instead of main content area
3. **Complex nested structure** making it difficult to debug

## Solution Implemented:

### 1. **Created Clean Component**
- Created `MobilePassengerDashboardFixed.jsx` with proper structure
- Removed duplicate content sections
- Fixed component hierarchy and layout

### 2. **Updated Route**
- Updated `/passenger/mobile` route to use the fixed component
- Maintained proper authentication and role checking

### 3. **Applied Brand Colors**
- Used your brand colors throughout the component:
  - Primary: `#FF416C` (pink) for headers, buttons, accents
  - Accent Teal: `#00BFA6` for highlights and icons
  - Text: `#1A1A1A` for headers, `#4B5563` for body text
  - Backgrounds: `#F9FAFB` for light areas, `#FFFFFF` for cards
  - Borders: `#E5E7EB` for subtle separators

## Features of Fixed Dashboard:

### 📱 **Clean Mobile Layout**
- Proper header with YATRIK ERP branding
- Tabbed navigation (Dashboard, My Trips, Search, Profile)
- Mobile menu overlay with quick actions

### 🎯 **Dashboard Tab**
- Welcome message with user's name
- Quick stats (upcoming trips, wallet balance)
- Quick search suggestions with your brand colors
- Quick action buttons (Bookings, Track Bus, Wallet, Offers)

### 🎫 **My Trips Tab**
- Displays user's upcoming trips
- Loading state with spinner
- Empty state with search suggestion

### 🔍 **Search Tab**
- Quick access to main search functionality
- Redirects to mobile landing page

### 👤 **Profile Tab**
- User information display
- Logout functionality

## Testing:

1. **Access the dashboard**: Navigate to `/passenger/mobile` after login
2. **Check all tabs**: Dashboard, My Trips, Search, Profile should all work
3. **Test navigation**: Quick actions should navigate to correct pages
4. **Verify styling**: Should match your brand colors and design

## Expected Result:
The mobile passenger dashboard should now display properly with:
- ✅ Visible content in all tabs
- ✅ Proper navigation and interactions
- ✅ Your brand colors applied consistently
- ✅ Clean, professional mobile interface

The blank white screen issue should be completely resolved!
