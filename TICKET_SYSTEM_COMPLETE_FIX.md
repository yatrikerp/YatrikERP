# Passenger Ticket Display & Email System - Complete Fix

## Overview
This document details all fixes applied to ensure that passenger tickets display accurate information including correct passenger names, route details, pricing, bus information, and conductor details. The QR code is also sent to the passenger's email with all correct details.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Passenger Name Display**
- **Problem**: Ticket displayed "Guest Passenger" instead of actual booked passenger name
- **Solution**: 
  - Updated booking API endpoint to properly return `customer.name`
  - Modified frontend to use `bookingData.customer?.name` as the primary source
  - Fallback to seat passenger name if customer name is not available

### 2. **Correct Route Details (From/To Places)**
- **Problem**: Route details were inconsistent or showing default values
- **Solution**:
  - Backend now returns complete journey details from `booking.journey`
  - Frontend prioritizes `booking.journey.from` and `booking.journey.to`
  - Proper fallback chain: journey ‚Üí route ‚Üí trip ‚Üí defaults

### 3. **Accurate Pricing**
- **Problem**: Amount displayed didn't match actual booking pricing
- **Solution**:
  - Backend returns complete pricing breakdown:
    - `booking.pricing.totalAmount` - Total fare
    - `booking.pricing.baseFare` - Base fare
    - `booking.pricing.taxes.gst` - GST amount
    - Seat-specific pricing from `seats[].price`
  - Frontend displays correct amount: `bookingData.pricing?.totalAmount || bookingData.pricing?.total`

### 4. **Bus Information**
- **Problem**: Bus details (number, type) were not displayed correctly
- **Solution**:
  - Backend populates bus details with `.populate('busId', 'busNumber busType')`
  - Returns structured bus object:
    ```javascript
    bus: {
      busNumber: booking.busId?.busNumber,
      busType: booking.busId?.busType
    }
    ```
  - Frontend displays bus number and type from response

### 5. **Conductor & Driver Details** ‚≠ê NEW
- **Problem**: Conductor and driver information was not shown on tickets
- **Solution**:
  - **Backend Enhancement**:
    - Created new endpoint `/api/booking/pnr/:pnr` that populates trip with conductor and driver
    - Uses nested populate:
      ```javascript
      .populate({
        path: 'tripId',
        populate: [
          { path: 'driverId', select: 'name email phone' },
          { path: 'conductorId', select: 'name email phone' }
        ]
      })
      ```
    - Returns conductor and driver objects:
      ```javascript
      conductor: {
        name: 'Conductor Name',
        email: 'conductor@yatrik.com',
        phone: '+91-XXXXXXXXXX'
      },
      driver: {
        name: 'Driver Name',
        email: 'driver@yatrik.com',
        phone: '+91-XXXXXXXXXX'
      }
      ```
  
  - **Frontend Display**:
    - Added new "Crew Information" section in ticket display
    - Shows driver and conductor cards with:
      - Name
      - Phone number
      - Email address
    - Displays "To be assigned" if crew member not assigned yet
    - Beautiful gradient card design with icons

### 6. **QR Code Email with Complete Details** ‚≠ê ENHANCED
- **Problem**: Email QR code ticket didn't include all passenger details
- **Solution**:
  - **Email Template Enhancement** (backend/config/email.js):
    - `ticketConfirmationWithQR` template includes:
      - ‚úÖ Exact passenger name from booking
      - ‚úÖ Correct from/to cities
      - ‚úÖ Accurate departure and arrival times
      - ‚úÖ Correct pricing with breakdown
      - ‚úÖ Bus number and type
      - ‚úÖ **Conductor details** (name, email, phone)
      - ‚úÖ **Driver details** (name, email, phone)
      - ‚úÖ QR code image embedded in email
      - ‚úÖ Seat numbers
      - ‚úÖ Booking ID/PNR
  
  - **Email Sending** (backend/routes/payment.js):
    - After successful payment verification
    - Generates ticket with QR code
    - Sends email with complete ticket data including crew info
    - Marks `booking.notifications.emailSent = true`

    select: 'serviceDate startTime endTime fare capacity driverId conductorId',
    populate: [
      { path: 'driverId', select: 'name email phone' },
      { path: 'conductorId', select: 'name email phone' }
    ]

const conductor = booking.tripId?.conductorId ? {
  name: booking.tripId.conductorId.name,
  email: booking.tripId.conductorId.email,
  phone: booking.tripId.conductorId.phone
} : null;

const driver = booking.tripId?.driverId ? {
