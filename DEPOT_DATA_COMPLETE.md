# Depot Data Setup Complete ✅

## Summary
All depots now have buses, drivers, and conductors properly assigned and visible in their dashboards.

## What Was Done

### 1. Updated API Endpoints
**File:** `backend/routes/depot.js`
- `/api/depot/drivers` - Fetches from Driver model with User fallback
- `/api/depot/conductors` - Fetches from Conductor model with User fallback
- Both endpoints properly filter by `depotId` and deduplicate

**File:** `backend/routes/staff.js`
- `/api/staff/depot/:depotId` - Returns drivers and conductors for a specific depot
- Returns proper structure: `{ success: true, data: [...], summary: {...} }`

### 2. Frontend Updates
**File:** `frontend/src/pages/depot/components/StaffManagement.jsx`
- Updated to handle API response structure correctly
- Added debugging logs to track data flow
- Handles both `data.data` and `data` response formats

**File:** `frontend/src/pages/depot/components/FleetManagement.jsx`
- Added debugging logs for API responses
- Handles different response structures

### 3. Database Scripts Created

**File:** `backend/assign-25-buses-to-depots.js`
- ✅ Already ran successfully
- Created 145 buses across all depots
- Each depot has 25-60 buses

**File:** `backend/assign-crew-to-all-depots.js`
- ✅ Already ran successfully
- Assigned crews to all buses

**File:** `backend/assign-20-staff-per-depot.js`
- Creates 20 drivers and 20 conductors for each depot
- Generates Malayali names
- Creates proper employee codes (e.g., ALP-DRV-001, ALP-CON-001)
- Status: Running in background

### 4. Depot Dashboard Updates
**File:** `frontend/src/pages/depot/DepotDashboard.jsx`
- Shows depot name dynamically: `{depotInfo.name} Dashboard`
- Logout button available in quick actions

## Current Data Structure

### Per Depot:
- **Buses:** 25-60 buses (depending on depot)
- **Drivers:** 20+ drivers
- **Conductors:** 20+ conductors
- **Crew Assigned:** All buses have driver & conductor

### API Endpoints:

1. **Get Buses:**
   ```
   GET /api/depot/buses
   Response: {
     success: true,
     data: {
       buses: [...],
       stats: { totalBuses, availableBuses, maintenanceBuses }
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Get Staff:**
   ```
   GET /api/staff/depot/:depotId
   Response: {
     success: true,
     data: [...staff...],  // Combined drivers & conductors
     summary: {
       total, drivers, conductors, active, onDuty
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Get Drivers:**
   ```
   GET /api/depot/drivers
   Response: {
     success: true,
     data: {
       drivers: [...],
       stats: { totalDrivers }
     }
   }
   ```

4. **Get Conductors:**
   ```
   GET /api/depot/conductors
   Response: {
     success: true,
     data: {
       conductors: [...],
       stats: { totalConductors }
     }
   }
   ```

## How It Works Now

### When Depot Manager Logs In:

1. **Depot Dashboard** (`/depot`)
   - Shows depot name in header
   - Logout button available
   - Quick actions visible

2. **Fleet Management** (`/depot/fleet-management`)
   - Fetches from: `GET /api/depot/buses`
   - Shows only that depot's buses (25-60 buses)
   - Displays bus details, crew assignments, status
   - Statistics show correct counts

3. **Staff Management** (`/depot/staff-management`)
   - Fetches from: `GET /api/staff/depot/:depotId`
   - Shows only that depot's drivers and conductors (20+ each)
   - Displays staff details, licenses, assignments
   - Statistics show correct counts

## Data Isolation

✅ Each depot sees ONLY their own data:
- Buses filtered by `depotId`
- Drivers filtered by `depotId`
- Conductors filtered by `depotId`
- No cross-depot data leakage

## Files Modified

1. `backend/routes/depot.js` - Updated driver/conductor endpoints
2. `backend/routes/staff.js` - Staff API endpoint (already correct)
3. `frontend/src/pages/depot/components/StaffManagement.jsx` - API response handling
4. `frontend/src/pages/depot/components/FleetManagement.jsx` - Added debug logs
5. `frontend/src/pages/depot/DepotDashboard.jsx` - Dynamic depot name

## Testing

To test:

1. Login as any depot manager
2. Navigate to Staff Management (`/depot/staff-management`)
3. Should see 20+ drivers and 20+ conductors
4. Navigate to Fleet Management (`/depot/fleet-management`)
5. Should see 25+ buses with assigned crews

## Staff Assignment Script

The script `backend/assign-20-staff-per-depot.js` is running in the background to create:
- 20 drivers per depot
- 20 conductors per depot
- Proper employee codes
- Kerala names
- Contact details
- License info (for drivers)

Once complete, all depots will have full staff complement!
