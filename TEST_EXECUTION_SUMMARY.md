## 🐛 Known Issues & Workarounds

### 1. Email Validation Timeout
**Issue:** Email availability check may timeout during signup  
**Workaround:** Increase wait time in test from 2s to 5s  
**Status:** Non-critical, doesn't affect core functionality

### 2. Dynamic Seat Availability
**Issue:** Selected seats may become unavailable during test  
**Workaround:** Select multiple seats, retry logic implemented  
**Status:** Expected behavior in concurrent environment

### 3. Payment Gateway Test Mode
**Issue:** Razorpay requires configuration in test environment  
**Workaround:** Use "Test Mode: Skip Payment" button  
**Status:** Feature, not a bug - intentional for testing

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Tests Timing Out

**Problem:** Tests fail with timeout errors  
**Solution:**
```javascript
test.setTimeout(120000); // Increase to 2 minutes
```

### Elements Not Found

**Problem:** "Element not visible" errors  
**Solution:**
1. Check servers are running
2. Verify selectors in code
3. Add explicit waits:
```javascript
await page.waitForSelector('button:has-text("Sign in")', { 
  timeout: 10000 
});
```

### API Connection Issues

**Problem:** Backend API not responding  
**Solution:**
1. Verify backend is running: `curl http://localhost:5000/api/health`
2. Check port 5000 is free
3. Review backend console for errors
