   - Check for overlapping assignments
   - Review crew work hour limits

### Validation Steps
1. Verify depot creation: `/admin/depots`
2. Verify route creation: `/admin/streamlined-routes`
3. Verify bus creation: `/admin/streamlined-buses`
4. Verify staff creation: `/admin/staff`
5. Run scheduling: `/admin/mass-scheduling`
