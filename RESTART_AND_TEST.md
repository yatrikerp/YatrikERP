## 🔧 Why You're Not Seeing Changes

**React/Vite needs to reload the new routes!**

The files are created and routes are configured, but the development server needs to restart to recognize them.

---

## 🚀 How to Fix (3 Simple Steps)

### Step 1: Restart Frontend Server

**Option A: Stop and Start**
```bash
# In your frontend terminal:
1. Press Ctrl+C to stop the server
2. Run: npm run dev
3. Wait for "Local: http://localhost:5173/"
```

**Option B: If server is already running**
```bash
# Just refresh it:
1. Press Ctrl+C
2. npm run dev
```

### Step 2: Clear Browser Cache

**Hard Refresh:**
- **Windows/Linux**: Press `Ctrl + Shift + R`
- **Mac**: Press `Cmd + Shift + R`

OR

**Clear cache:**
- Press `F12` to open DevTools
- Right-click the refresh button
- Select "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"

### Step 3: Test the Flow

1. Visit: http://localhost:5173/
2. Scroll to "Popular Routes"
3. Click "Book" on any route
4. You should see the new flow!

## 🧪 Quick Test Commands

### Terminal 1 - Frontend:
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

### Terminal 2 - Backend (if not running):
```bash
cd backend
npm start
```

---

## ✅ What Should Happen

### After Restart:

1. **Click "Book"** on Popular Route
   - Should save booking context
   - Should redirect to login (if not logged in)

2. **After Login**
   - Should redirect to `/booking-choice`
   - Should show choice screen with:
     * Welcome message
     * Your selected route
     * Two option cards

3. **Choose "Continue Booking"**
   - Should go to `/passenger/results`
   - Should show trip search results

---

## 🔍 Verify Routes are Loaded

### Check in Browser Console:

Open DevTools (F12) and run:
```javascript
// Check if routes exist
console.log('BookingChoice loaded:', window.location.pathname === '/booking-choice');

// Navigate to test
window.location.href = '/booking-choice';
```

### Check React Router:

In DevTools Console:
```javascript
// After clicking Book button, check localStorage
console.log(JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('pendingBooking')));

// Should show:
// {
//   from: "...",
//   to: "...",
//   date: "...",
//   source: "popular_routes_landing"
// }
```
