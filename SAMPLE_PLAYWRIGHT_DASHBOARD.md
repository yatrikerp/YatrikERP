## 💡 Tips for Developers

### Before Committing Code
```bash
# Run tests locally
npm run test:playwright

# Fix any failures
npx playwright test --debug --grep "failed test"

# Commit only if all critical tests pass
```

### Writing New Tests
```javascript
// Use descriptive test names
test('User should be able to book a seat successfully', async ({ page }) => {
  // Test implementation
});

// Add proper waits
await page.waitForLoadState('networkidle');

// Use data-testid for stable selectors
await page.click('[data-testid="book-now-button"]');
```

### Handling Flaky Tests
```javascript
// Add retries for unstable tests
test.describe.configure({ retries: 2 });

// Use proper timeouts
await expect(element).toBeVisible({ timeout: 10000 });
```
