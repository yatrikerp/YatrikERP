# Depot Dashboard Setup Summary

## ✅ Fixed Issues

### 1. Staff Management Error
**Error:** "No depot ID found for user"

**Fix Applied:** 
- Updated `frontend/src/pages/depot/components/StaffManagement.jsx` to fetch depot ID from API if not in localStorage
- Falls back to `/api/depot/info` endpoint if depotId is missing from user object

### 2. Database Setup
**Scripts Created:**
- `backend/assign-25-buses-to-depots.js` - Assigns 25 buses to each depot ✅
- `backend/assign-crew-to-all-depots.js` - Assigns crews to buses ✅
- `backend/assign-20-staff-per-depot.js` - Creates 20 drivers and 20 conductors per depot ✅

**Database Status:**
- All depots have 25-60 buses
- Most depots have 20+ drivers and conductors
- Some depots still need staff (running in background)

### 3. API Endpoints Updated
- `/api/depot/buses` - Returns depot-specific buses ✅
- `/api/depot/drivers` - Returns depot-specific drivers ✅
- `/api/depot/conductors` - Returns depot-specific conductors ✅
- `/api/staff/depot/:depotId` - Returns all staff for a depot ✅

## ⚠️ Remaining Issue

The error still appears because:
1. When depot manager logs in, the user object doesn't have `depotId`
2. Need to ensure depot authentication stores depotId in the user object

## 🔧 Quick Fix Needed

Check the depot login authentication flow and ensure that when a depot manager logs in:
1. The depot ID is retrieved from the backend
2. It's stored in localStorage as `user.depotId`
3. Or use the `/api/depot/info` endpoint to get depot details

## 📊 Current Status

### Working:
- ✅ Buses are assigned to depots
- ✅ Crews are assigned to buses
- ✅ API endpoints return correct filtered data
- ✅ Staff management attempts to fetch depot info from API

### In Progress:
- 🔄 Staff assignment for all depots (background script)
- ⚠️ Depot authentication storing depotId

### Next Steps:
1. Fix depot login to store depotId
2. Verify staff management loads data correctly
3. Test with actual depot manager login
